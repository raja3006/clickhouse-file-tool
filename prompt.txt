Create a modern web application for bidirectional data transfer between ClickHouse and flat files. The application should have a clean interface and support both CSV and TSV formats.

Design a scalable backend in Go that can handle large datasets efficiently with proper error handling and connection pooling. Include JWT authentication for ClickHouse connections.

Implement a React frontend with Material-UI components that provides a multi-step wizard for data transfer, real-time progress tracking, and data preview functionality.

Set up Docker containers for both backend and frontend, but also make it work with local ClickHouse installation. Include proper environment configuration and error handling.

Optimize data transfer with batch processing and implement proper logging. Add a test script to verify all functionality.

Create comprehensive documentation including setup instructions, API specifications, and usage examples.
